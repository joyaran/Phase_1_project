This project analyzes aviation accident data from the National Transport Safety Board, covering civil aviation accidents and selected incidents that occured in the United States and international waters from 1962 to 2023.By extensive data analysis of this dataset, we aim to identify aircrafts with impeccable safety records.

The major focus areas for this analysis will be on quantifiable metrics like aircraft damage, total fatalities in accidents while comparing them to aircraft categories, make and engine types. Ultimately, Mawingu group of companies aims to build a foundation for long-term success in the aviation industry by prioritizing the safety of its crew and customers.

### Business Problem

Choosing aricraft models know to be safe is not only important for our customers' safety but also for the business's finances and reputation. 

Assessing historical aviation accident data offers a valuable opportunity to identify key trends, patterns and risk factors linked to different airplane models. This data driven approach will enable us to make informed decisions, as we will prioritize aircraft models with proven track records of safety and avoid those with recurring safety issues.

### Data Understanding

The goal is to explore the National Transportation Safety Board data and identify key features that we can use to assess the risks associated with various aircrafts. 

### Data Cleaning

After exploring the data, I need to clean the data to make it easier to work with. There are columns and rows that might not be useful for our analysis and we are better of dropping them.

### Data Visualizations

We will graphically analyze key variables and their relationships to identify risk factors, patterns and trends across the dataset. The desired outcome of this is to deduce clear and actionable insights for Mawingu Group's aviation business decisions.
